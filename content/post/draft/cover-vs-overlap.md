# Cover Select vs Overlap Select

Interactive programs, dealing with selecting multiple objects, there are many ways.

CTRL : select multiple
SHIFT: Select consecutive

Visual programs, like for diagramming, its sometimes easier to selct using an area drawn by your mouse.

# Overlap Select

Visio??? does this.

(need image of selecting with Visio)

- Easy to select a bunch of stuff with a small rectangle (eh?)

- Error prone, hard to single out a single object when they are close together

# Cover Select

PowerPoint does this.

To select something you need to completely cover the object with your selection

- more explicit
- Helps when you have overlapping objects and you want to select a specific one
