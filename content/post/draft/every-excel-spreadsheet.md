# Every Excel Spreadsheet

- Freeze panes (probably at about B2)
Need to freeze the top row
May need to freeze 1 or more left columns

- DATA / Filter
1. click in the table
2. CTRL+A
3. In the ribbon click DATA > Filter
4. Answer the prompt

Voila!  Now you have a usable data table you can filter, sort and scroll through

There's no excuse not to have an excel spreadsheet without these basic features turned on.
